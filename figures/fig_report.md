# Visalisation Report

## Datasets for visualisation

Train data:
Using train data for for visualisations involving target variable information - e.g. using "Survived" as the hue ot target. This is to prevent data leaking in the modelling section.

All data:
Using all data for any demogrpahic or feature distribution visualisatinos that dont involve survival rates.

## Existing Visualisations

Two main visualisation functions were used: count plots and distribution plots. Count plots display the frequency of observations in each category of a variable. Distribution plots show the distribution of continuous numerical variables; it represents the requency of different value ranges withing the variable.

The current fuctions displays two count plots for each vairable in [] in both the all data and train data, one with survived as hue and one without. It also displays two distribution plots for each variable in [] from both datasets, one with survived as hue and one without.
